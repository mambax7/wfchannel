	When you first enter the Upload file area you will be shown one selection box with three choices.
	These choices represent the different upload area's defines in the configuration.  You MUST select a field before
	the other parts of this are shown!

		This will allow you to choose which area your file will be uploaded to
	2,	File viewer
		Depending on the choice in one, you will either be shown the image or HTML select box.  
		The image select box will allow you to view the selected image.  (I will add an option to view HTML files in the next version).
