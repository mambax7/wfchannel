    Ok, this one is a little bit different and is a bit hard to explain, but here I go :-)

    This upload area is dynamic, in such that it will show different parts for each selection.

    When you first enter the Upload file area you will be shown one selection box with three choices.
    These choices represent the different upload area's defines in the configuration. You MUST select a field before
    the other parts of this are shown!

    <strong>1. The main select box</strong>
    This will allow you to choose which area your file will be uploaded to

    <strong>2. File viewer</strong>
    Depending on the choice in one, you will either be shown the image or HTML select box.
    The image select box will allow you to view the selected image. (I will add an option to view HTML files in the next version).

    This will allow you to choose and image or HTML file for uploading.
