We hope that this module suits your needs and hopefully, helps in some way to helping you create a website that you are looking for.</p><p>What is WF-Channel? This module will allow you to add content quickly and easily to your existing website, without the need to edit any html or having to upload files to your web server.</p><p>With WF-Channel, you can add many different pages, either as a standalone page or as part as one of the Menus that is provided within WF-Channel. This means that you are not restricted to having the category/article listing and each page can become an separate identity within your website.</p><p>Just about every part of WF-Channel can be changed to suit your needs, from the ability to display a menu title or not. This is the same for the icons, book marks and much more, and this gives you the freedom to have each page different from the other.</p><p>The administration of WF-Channel is totally different from any other module. It is easier to navigate and with many tools available to make the creation and administration of Pages easily as possible.&nbsp; You have the ability to mash update, duplicate and delete pages all at once just by a few clicks.</p><p>WF-Channel has the ability to search pages from the admin area, whether this is by their menu title, page title, content, related tags or publication date.

    wfc_content: '<p>The first thing you may want to do is create a new page, this is quite simple and easy to do. The basics require nothing more than a few simple steps to creating your new page.&nbsp; While all the tabs may look daunting at first, you will soon quickly realise that this procedure has been broken down into more easy manageable steps.</p><p>To create new pages simply follow these instructions.</p><ol start="1" type="1"><li>Navigate to the Xoops Administration and locate the WF-Channel module.</li><li>Once there, look for the create button that appears at the top right hand side. Please click this.</li><li>Once you have navigated to the &lsquo;New Page&rsquo; location, you will be presented with a form with a few tabs, &lsquo;Main, Publish, Image, Meta and Permissions. Each tab will allow you to manipulate the Page in a different way or to enhance the page in a certain way. But for now we will stick with the important tabs that will allow us to create our first page.</li><li>First, make sure that the &lsquo;Main&rsquo; tab is the active one.</li><li>The first field, Menu Title is the only required field within the form, so we have to make sure that we enter this field.</li><li>The next field is the &lsquo;Page Title&rsquo;. This is a general heading to convey to people what or page is trying to tell them in a quick concise manner. Try to keep this short and as straight to the point as much as you can.</li><li>Next we have the &lsquo;Page Content&rsquo;. This is the most important part of your page makeup and can be about anything that you desire. To make the page span over different pages you can use the [ pagebreak ] tag.</li><li>Rather than using text and html, you may consider using a page wrap to include your html files as the content of your page.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Page Wrap&rsquo; will allow you to enter the path of the html file and import the contents straight into the database or only when the Page is read. (This content will be cached for quicker loading).</li><li>The last item on this page will allow you to perform certain cleaning options is you so desire.<ol start="1" type="a"><li>Raw Formatting: Do nothing and leave the text as it was entered.</li><li>Html Cleansing: Check and clean any errors found in the html. This also includes compressing and make sure the html will comply with xhtml standards.</li><li>MS Word Cleaning: If you copy and paste straight from a Microsoft Word document, you will know that this can cause problems with formatting and extra garbage that is not required. It is recommended that you perform this action on MS word text.</li><li>This is a totally destructive mode. It will remove all html formatting and leave just plain text.</li></ol></li><li>The last step before we save our new page is to make sure that the right people have permission to view this page. This can be done by granting certain groups &lsquo;permissions&rsquo;. This can be achieved by clicking on the &lsquo;Permissions&rsquo; tab at the very end&rsquo; (Don&rsquo;t worry you will not lose your changes unless you navigate away from this form). Click the checkboxes nest to the groups that you wish to have permissions or simply click the &lsquo;Check All&rsquo; to give everyone permission to view this page.</li></ol><p>These are the first simple steps in creating a new page easily and quickly.</p>'
