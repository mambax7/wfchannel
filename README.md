WF-Channel is a XOOPS module to display Misc pages on your website. This module is not a replacement for a content module, 
though it could be easily used as such if required.

WF-Channel can also display a 'Link to Us' and 'Refer' pages.

Unlike many other content management tools written for XOOPS, WF-Channel is in many respects just a method 
of putting up content very quickly and not a full blown article management system. 
WF-Channel allows you to put up content when and where you want it, without having to worry about anything else.

**In order to use WF-Channel, you will need to install also [WF-Resource](https://github.com/mambax7/wfresource)**
