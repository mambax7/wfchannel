[i]What is WF-Channel?[/i]

Unlike many other content management tools written for Xoops, WF-Channel is in many respects just a method of putting up
content very quickly and not a full blown article management system. WF-Channel allows you to put up content when and where
you want it, without having to worry about anything else.
